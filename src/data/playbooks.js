      <p>Stop measuring vanity metrics. In a local business, density matters more than reach. How many customers do you have within a 1km radius?</p>
      
      <h3>2. The Anchor Strategy</h3>
      <p>Find businesses that share your customer but not your product. If you're a gym, partner with the health food store and the physio next door. Cross-pollinate.</p>
      
      <h3>3. The Referral Loop</h3>
      <p>Don't just ask for referrals. Build them into the product experience. Give users a status-driven reason to bring a friend.</p>

      <p>If you can get a customer to visit 3 times within 30 days, their retention probability triples. Obsess over that first month.</p>
